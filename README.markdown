# Container Queries Presentation

These code examples were used in part for a talk given to the Front-End Meetup in St. Petersburg, Florida on September 14, 2017.

The grid system, CSS reset, and some mixins come from Bootstrap 4 only in the effort to simply presentation to focus on the Container Query demos.

## Demos Included

* Card Pattern Component
* Movie Listing Component

## Setup Notes

* Sass files are found within `/src/scss/` and compiled into `/web/assets/css/application[.min].css` by Gulp.
* PHP Files are used to demo the concept of requiring the module files in various contexts.
